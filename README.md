# 🔐 Password Generator – Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **command-line Password Generator** developed using **Python**.  
It generates a random password based on user-defined criteria such as the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

The goal of this project is to practice **core Python programming concepts** while building a small, real-world utility.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

I created this project to understand how **randomness and user inputs** can be combined to generate secure and customizable outputs.

Password generation is a practical problem that involves:

- Controlled randomness
    
- List manipulation
    
- Logical construction of strings
    

This project helped strengthen my fundamentals before moving toward advanced applications.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

- Python lists and list operations
    
- Random value selection using `random.choice()`
    
- Shuffling data using `random.shuffle()`
    
- User input handling with `input()`
    
- Loops and conditional logic
    
- String manipulation

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Implement randomness in Python programs
    
- Work effectively with lists and strings
    
- Combine multiple user-defined constraints into a single output
    
- Build small but useful command-line utilities
    

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add input validation for incorrect values
    
- Allow multiple password generations in one run
    
- Convert the logic into reusable functions
    
- Add password strength indicators
    
- Build a GUI or web-based version
